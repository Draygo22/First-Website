The result is a state-of-the-art bass for the most discriminating musician.</div>

No single piece of gear Roland has introduced since their Fantom series keyboards even come close to offering you the no-holds-barred music-production power of the FA-06 keyboard workstation. It all starts off with the sounds – a collection of over 2,000 patches taken from the flagship INTEGRA-7 sound module including the complete SuperNATURAL synth engine. Add to that an absolutely astonishing set of effects and processors, and you’re still just getting started. Powerful onboard sequencing and sampling let you build up your tracks, and killer performance options make playing on the FA-06 a blast. Top it off with an awesome user interface, total DAW integration, and a great-feeling semi-weighted 61-note keyboard, and you’re in business!
